## Imdb
This is a react project created using vite.
The project is built with vite and react.

To clone the project copy this code to your terminal and run
```
https://github.com/Nexus-coder/imdb.git
```

Now move into the project
```
cd imdb
```

To run the project run

```
npm run dev
```

For this application I used react to bring it to life and added various responsive states using it.
Key takeways are :
* useContext - hook which I use to maintain the whole state of the application.
* useQuery - which is a library that helps in fetching and caching of data in the app.
* tailwind css - which is a css library.
